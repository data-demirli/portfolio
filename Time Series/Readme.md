# Time Series - Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)

## Summary:
**Dataset:** Daily temperature values with their corresponding dates  
**Model:** Predicts the temperature for the following date  
**Particulars:** Sliding window containing time lags, neural-network with recurrent layers (LSTM and GRU)
